# Deep-Learning-Assignments
Welcome to my Deep Learning Assignments repository! This repository contains four assignments that cover various aspects of deep learning, implemented using PyTorch. Each assignment focuses on specific topics, providing hands-on experience and learning opportunities.

## Assignment 1: Simple Linear Regression with PyTorch

Learn the basics of loading data, creating a train/test split, and building a simple linear regression model using PyTorch. Train the model with the gradient descent algorithm to solve regression problems.

## Assignment 2: Neural Network Fundamentals

Dive into neural networks, deep neural networks, loss functions, and optimization techniques. Build a simple neural network using numpy to understand backpropagation. Explore gradient checking, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Assignment 3: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation

Explore the world of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PyTorch. Write a custom dataset in PyTorch with training, validation, and test sets. Build and train a CNN to classify images, gaining practical experience with image recognition tasks.

## Assignment 4: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Implementation

Delve into the realm of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in PyTorch. Build a GAN, load pretrained parameters, and train the network for image generation. Evaluate the performance of your GAN and understand the principles behind generative models.
